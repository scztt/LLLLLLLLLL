A music list for 2017
=====================

I've been half-attentively putting together a list of music for 2017. I won't
call it a best of, and it's not in any particular order - mostly just the things
I found most notable, or ended up coming back to the most. Missing from this
list is a whole pile of fantastic techno, shaken to the surface in an email
thread bubbling since last winter - I only included a few more album-like
releases on here.

DJ Richard \@ Kremwerk, Seattle *(first show of the year, a lovely friend visit,
and a killer set)*

Pharmakon \@ Berghain, Berlin

Etapp Kyle's overnight set \@ Berghain, Berlin *(mostly just because this was
the last show of this Berlin trip, and only the second Klubnacht I'd ever been
to)*

a surprise-ish Iceage show \@ Mayhem, Copenhagen *(I was only there for a few
days and got lucky enough to overlap with this - got a bunch of my shit stolen,
and I think I've got a pair of shoes still semi-mud-caked from this night, but
it was still beyond worth it)*

Umfang \@ Kremwerk, Seattle

Yves Tumor \@ Kremwerk, Seattle *(the space was flooded with fog and the running
order had changed, so we weren't even sure who this was - just washes of noise
and a huge figure slipping back and forth between the stage and the audience)*

A Story of Rats (Debacle fest closing show) \@ Columbia City Theater, Seattle

DVS1 \@ mobius cycles warehouse, Seattle *(just 7 or so hours of DVS1...)*
